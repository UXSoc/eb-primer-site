You are the right hand of the President.

You are a fortress. Your passion for the
organization is as impenetrable as the President. You will do anything
to defend it and preach it.

Anything she does, you are able to do — and more.
You are ready to take her place anytime when the situation calls for it.

You are not just a supporting role. You are a main character.
You probably have the most important role among all.

You fill in the gaps your President cannot fill.
You understand that she cannot do it alone, neither can the
organization. With your veteran expertise, people can rely on you and
trust you to keep the organization going. You are there at the most
difficult situations.

You have more flexibility in making things
happen. You don’t take that for granted. You pounce on opportunities the
organization can undertake fearlessly — whether it be through
multimedia, partnerships, branding, potential events, and more.

You are as concerned with how the organization
performs and you double down on how we can become 10x. You are always
thinking of the organization roadmap and execute what you think is best
for the organization.

As the executive among the VPs, you are the
manager. You are deeply concerned with each of their growth. You
schedule individual consultations, hold honest conversations, and find
the root of the matter whenever they do not perform well.

Your excellent work ethic, standards of quality,
and can-do attitude takes the organization far more than it could be
without you.
