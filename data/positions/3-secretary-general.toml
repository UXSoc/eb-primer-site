You are the main driving force of the organization in keeping itself sane.

You carry out your duty by making sure every meeting is well-documented. Under each agenda, you take note of how decisions are made, who makes the suggestions, and what next steps are.

EB meetings are not carried out unless there is a clear agenda. You respect everyoneâ€™s time and are familiar with systems you must implement to make sure the organization is well-documented, efficient, and effective.

This means you have a strong knowledge of information architecture and knowledge management, and you have a strong opinion on how files, processes, schedules, databases, and systems are written and pinned down. More importantly, you know how to make sense of these and make the most out of it.

You are a collaborator. You communicate individually with EB members to understand their needs and how you can best help them.

If the organization decides to become an accredited organization in the future, you are in-charge of seeing it to fruition. You calmly analyze where the organization is and what steps are needed to get where it wants to be.

You understand that your role is consequential to a bright future of the organization. You have superb work ethic, documentation skills, and a slight obsessive-compulsive tendency when it come to handling your work.

You understand that documentation is necessary, but it is not the end-all and be-all. You are familiar with SCRUM and agile methodologies and are taking proactive steps to incorporate that into our organizational design.
