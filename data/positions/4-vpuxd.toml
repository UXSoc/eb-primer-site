You are most passionate with implementing UX in the real world.

You understand that the UX Design department is the cash cow of the organization, and so your efforts are nothing less than the best.

You have an unquenchable thirst to hone your visual design, interaction design, and user experience design skills. You have a solid understanding of branding. You also have been engaged in freelance projects where you have experience handling clients.

You are always updated about the latest tools, trends, design and UX concepts, visual languages, design systems, and type families this world has to offer.

You have a solid understanding of how business ties into the UX design process. Likewise, after strategizing projects, you know how to diverge and work on ideas, converge to work on an appealing solution, and work on a robust prototype of the product or service you are designing.

You are obsessed with UX design case studies, and you are aspiring to write compelling content for our websites and our clientâ€™s digital properties. This is why you carefully document the design process you have undergone to create our client websites and systems.

You understand what design thinking means by heart. Along with all of those jargon like human-centered design, user-centric design, and UI/UX design. You can differentiate among them and paint a clear picture of how you are going to explain this to the client.

You understand how important clients are and you know how to price your services based on the value you provide.

You know how valuable UX is and you are the progenitor of its execution within the organization. You are always available for consultation from other members and are deeply invested in the design education of the organization.

You are an agent of change in the university and beyond, constantly helping organizations do greater work through user experience.
