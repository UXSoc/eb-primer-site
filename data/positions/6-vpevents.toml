You are a UX evangelist. You want to spread the knowledge of user experience so badly that you want every event to be a success.

Success for you means that the end-user’s goal is achieved in the best way possible. Aside from this, you take special note of the goal of every event and do all it takes to accomplish it.

You are not afraid to deviate from normal, boring events. What matters to you is innovation. You are fearless in changing the dynamics of an event, as long as it aims to provide tremendous value towards attendees and participants. Because you don’t want to waste their time.

You are familiar with Ateneo’s (rigorous) mechanisms with regards to venue reservations and project proposals. If not, you are ready to learn them, immerse in them, and give your soul to them. It’s okay, if it means you can positively impact the people around you.

You know how to deploy project teams, manage expectations and motivations, and pick the right people for the right job. You understand UX enough to get people to join you in launching successful events.

You consult with the top officers in order to make sure you are doing the right thing. You are open to taking feedback, ideas, and suggestions from those more experienced from you. More than the top officers’ feedback, you empathize with your attendees — you understand what they need the most.

When an event is happening, you don’t just sit around and do nothing. You personally get to know the participants, understand why they joined the event, and do what it takes to optimize the event for the future in order to get more attendees.

You’re obsessed with crossing out checklists for every project. You understand how important the kickoff meeting and post-event meeting is. You are able to document each project well and track how it is doing through gantt charts, schedules, deliverables, and milestones.

You are a strong project manager but an even stronger designer — you are an events designer. You understand how UX principles, customer experience and service design play into creating events.

That is why all the events are nothing short of excellent, exhibiting superior quality over quantity.
