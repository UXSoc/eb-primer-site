You love the words “member engagement” and make sure everybody at UX Society feels at home.

Through your HR initiatives, you find different ways to get people to know each other. You provide the platforms for members to bond, without the stresses of organizational life.

You are the main link of the organization in discovering new talent. You’re in charge of recruiting members all-year-round.

Aside from this, you meticulously plan how officers are recruited, trained, and immersed in the UX way of life. Because of your efforts, no one is left behind or feeling alone, untrained, or unnurtured.

You are the organization’s main internal communication channel. You can gauge the sentiment of the members. You listen. You hold multiple ICs with representatives from all departments, and try to understand what strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats there are to work on. Because of you, people are supported for speaking up — not punished.

You know everyone by name. You take note of every officer’s and EB member’s birthday, and make sure they have the best birthday message on the UX Fam group.

You are able to recognize the efforts of exceptional members and create a system that makes sure these efforts do not go unnoticed. You are the main driving force in motivating members to always come back to UX Society.

With you around, UX Society will always feel like a family.
