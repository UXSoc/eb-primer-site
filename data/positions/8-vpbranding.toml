You are a storyteller.

With your deep knowledge of design, you are able to maintain the excellent quality of marketing collaterals and multimedia that UX Society produces.

You have a strong creative process that focuses on the heart of every publication material — the message. You are amazing at communicating the essence of our events, through your expertise in illustration, graphic design, photography, videography, and user interface design.

Your visual design skills know no equal. Your peers often come to you for a second look at their promotional materials.

Aside from individual skill, you are a great manager. You are able to motivate your officers to contribute to our existing brand identity, and are personally involved in the growth of the people you lead.

You are able to espouse the core principles of UX Society through branding. You understand that we are an open community of design leaders who want to educate the next generation.

Aside from aesthetics, you are cognizant of the importance of quality promotions in achieving UX Society’s business goals. You are equipped with the necessary skills in content strategy and content planning in order to accomplish our goals.

Your co-EB members can often rely on you, even if it’s at the last minute. Despite this, you do your work with a smile on your face, because you know your “why,” and how important it is to get our message across through a powerful story.

You don’t stop learning, optimizing your design, and growing in order to create and execute the best possible brand strategy.
