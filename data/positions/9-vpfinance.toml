You are the lifeblood of the organization.

Without you to keep the organization’s financials in check, organizing events and continuing to provide our service to clients can become problematic.

You set systems to track where our finances go. You are obsessed with getting receipts, tallying expenses, and analyzing our financial health so that we know where we can better invest our money.

You are often collaborating with the UX Design department in order to secure payments from clients. It is not unnatural for you to be handling MoA’s and other similar documents. You are also able to keep track of expenses such as hosting and domain management fees, SSL certificates, and more.

Aside from the UX Design department, you have your own income-based projects — whether in the form of shirt sales, bake sales, and the like, getting extra income is possible.

You know how the organization can benefit from its own bank account. And so you take proactive steps to ensure we create one.

You are reliable when it comes to securing funds, and because of your efforts, the organization is never in debt and continues to operate in the best way possible.
